# Why was I banned from #feminism?

Our channel is named ##feminism - note the two hash characters. We do not control #feminism. The operators of #feminism quit irc years ago, and banned everybody from their channel, including us. Ideally we'd like it to redirect to ##feminism, but freenode won't transfer ownership because of [channel naming rules](https://freenode.net/policies).

# Why did [xyz] get banned?

Our channel is regularly targeted by abusive and persistent trolls. Freenode only allows a limited number of channel bans, so our bot has to rotate them. This means many previous trolls are able to join for a few seconds before being re-banned. Please trust that there's a good reason. Moderating this channel is already emotionally exhausting enough without having to rehash everything on demand, especially to newcomers.

# Who gets voice (+v)?

Long story. We used to only give [+v](https://freenode.net/kb/answer/channelmodes) to non-men (i.e. women and nonbinary-gendered people - we called this "Misandry Mode"), then we gave it to all channel regulars, and lately we haven't bothered to hand it to new people since the channel is rarely [+m](https://freenode.net/kb/answer/channelmodes) anymore. So it doesn't mean anything.

# What is pinkwashing?

[Google it:](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=pinkwashing)

* Pinkwashing is a portmanteau compound word of the words pink and whitewashing. In the context of LGBT and intersex rights, it is used to describe a variety of marketing and political strategies aimed at promoting a product or an entity through an appeal to queer-friendliness, primarily by political or social activists.
