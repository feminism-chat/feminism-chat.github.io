> <small>Teachers were told that some group of children was intellectually gifted relative to the others. In fact the children were chosen randomly. At the end of the experiment the students teachers expected to be intellectually gifted actually scored higher on IQ tests than should have been expected and than the other randomly selected group. This was especially true in the first and second grades, possibly because students are less likely to have reputations among teachers at those ages.

> <small>"Characterizing the test as insensitive to gender differences was enough to totally eliminate women’s underperformance in this experiment. Yet when the same test was characterized as sensitive to gender differences, women signiﬁcantly underperformed in relation to equally qualiﬁed men."</small>

> <small>"We found that Asian-American women performed better on a mathematics test when their ethnic identity was activated, but worse when their gender identity was activated, compared with a control group who had neither identity activated. Cross-cultural investigation indicated that it was the stereotype, and not the identity per se, that influenced performance."</small>

> <small>"Two studies of college students investigated the conditions under which women perform better than men on an empathic accuracy task (inferring the thoughts and feelings of a target person). The first study demonstrated that women’s advantage held only when women were given a task assessing their feelings of sympathy toward the target prior to performing the empathic accuracy task. The second study demonstrated that payments in exchange for accuracy improved the performance of both men and women and wiped out any difference between men’s and women’s performances. Together, the results suggest that gender differences in empathic accuracy performance are the result of motivational differences and are not due to simple differences of ability between men and women."</small>
