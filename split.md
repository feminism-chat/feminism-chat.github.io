## On ##feminist and #feminism
The split in #feminism is the result of several days worth of unfortunate behavior. One of our mods had been participating in a way which we (the moderators) and other users felt was both combative and bullying in nature toward users and mods alike. This mod had previously been absent for approximately one month, in which time the channel grew in both activity and number of active and idle users as a result of an effort on the part of the moderation team and regular users. Objectionable actions by this mod are included but not limited to: Deopping other mods without first consulting the mod team, antagonising behavior, escalation of disagreements, bullying and failure to actively accept outside input.

This mod also happened to be the channel founder and thus had complete control over the channel. We did request control of the channel multiple times as we found this mod's behavior to be one which we could no longer stand behind. We extended an invitation for this mod to keep participating in the channel sans-modship, however, this mod did not agree to these terms and declined to transfer channel control. 

Given that the mods of [##feminist](ircs://chat.freenode.net:6697/%23%23feminist) are the very same who grew the original channel into a place of active participation, we sought to start our own channel with a modship we agree to and mods we can stand behind. Many of the users from the old channel have taken root in [##feminist](ircs://chat.freenode.net:6697/%23%23feminist), and we invite you all to stay and help this new channel grow into the best intersectional anti-oppression discussion space it can be. You are of course welcome to participate in both.
