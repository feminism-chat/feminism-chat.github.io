### CommentBlock
CommentBlock is an AdBlock subscription that hides the user comment section on various popular websites.
Most websites lack decent or any moderation of their commenting section, allowing an enviroment full of 
trolls, ignorance, and bigotry to become an unsettling echo chamber.

Tired of poorly moderated comment sections on your favourite sites? [Subscribe!](abp:subscribe?location=https://raw.github.com/freenode-feminists/CommentBlock/master/commentblock.txt&title=CommentBlock)
