## CommentBlock
[CommentBlock](https://github.com/freenode-feminists/CommentBlock/) is an AdBlock Plus filter subscription that hides the user comment section on various popular websites.
Most websites lack decent or any moderation of their commenting section, allowing an enviroment full of 
trolls, ignorance, and bigotry to become an unsettling echo chamber.

In order to use CommentBlock, you'll need to first install [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/), which is a 
browser extension to block adverts.

[Subscribe](abp:subscribe?location=https://raw.github.com/freenode-feminists/CommentBlock/master/commentblock.txt&title=CommentBlock) 
to these filters and never worry about reading awful comments again.
